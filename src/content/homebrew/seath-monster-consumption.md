# Monster Consumption

Seath can use his action to consume a part of a dead or unconscious creature, granting him special abilities depending on what was consumed. Effects last until a new creature is consumed. The creature must be an _Aberration_, _Dragon_, _Elemental_, _Giant_ or _Monstrosity_ and have a CR of 1 or more.

Saving throw DCs are equal to the DC of Seath's breath weapon.

## Monsters

### Yeti

You gain a +3 to scent-based perception checks. You can spend a charge of your breath weapon to choose a creature within 30 feet, the creature makes a Constitution saving throw and is paralysed for 1 minute on a failure. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

### Hag

When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to deal no damage and instead have all creatures in the effect make a wisdom saving throw and be frightened for 1 minute on a failure. A frightened creature repeats the start of their turns to end the effect.

### Ice Troll

As a bonus action, you can activate the consumed healing factor of the Ice Troll. For 1 minute, at the start of each of your turns, you regains hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. You regains use of this feature after finishing a long rest.

### Crag Cat

You have advantage on spell saving throws that target only you (not area of effect spells).

## Basilisk

Once per long rest you can target a number of creatures you can see and that can see you equal to your proficiency bonus. The creatures make a constitution saving throw, on a failure a thin layer of stone forms over their skin, they are restrained until the start of your next turn.

### Umber Hulk

Seath can expend a breathe weapon charge to activate _Confusing Gaze_, and can replace a bite attack with _Mandibles_, which behave identically to a bite except it deals slashing damage and has 2d8 damage dice.

**Confusing Gaze.** All creatures within 10 feet of Seath must make a charisma saving throw against Seath's Breath Weapon saving throw.

On a failed saving throw, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during that turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action but uses all its movement to move in a random direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes one melee attack against a random creature, or it does nothing if no creature is within reach.

## Consuming Dragons

Consuming a dragon changes the damage type of his breath weapon to match that of the dragon.
