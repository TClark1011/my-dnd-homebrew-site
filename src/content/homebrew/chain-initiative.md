# Initiative Variant: Chain Initiative

This variant rule offers an alternative approach to initiative tracking in combat encounters. Instead of individual initiative counts, creatures are grouped into "sides" based on their alignment or affiliation. This simplifies combat logistics while promoting strategic decision-making.

_**Side Initiative Counts.**_ In this system, initiative counts correspond to a "side" rather than an individual creature. Each "side" consists of a group of creatures with shared alignment or affiliation, such as player characters, allied NPCs, or monsters from the same faction. At the outset of each combat turn, the currently active side designates a single creature from their group to take their turn. A creature cannot act again until the start of the next round. The first turn of every combat round is reserved for player characters.

_**The Chain.**_ After a creature completes its turn, it must make a DC 10 check, incorporating any modifiers relevant to its initiative. If the check succeeds, the creature can choose another creature from its side to act next. The DC for this check increases by 2 with each successful use, resetting to 10 when a new side takes its turn.

If the check fails, initiative passes to the opposing side. When an NPC side fails the check, the next turn goes to the player characters. If the players fail the check and multiple NPC sides vie for the next turn, the Dungeon Master determines which side takes the next action.

At the conclusion of a creature's turn, if no other creatures from its side have yet to act in the current round, the check automatically fails. A surprised creature also automatically fails the check.

_**Lair Actions.**_ Lair actions occur after the first player character's turn of each round.

## Todo

- [x] Consider lair actions
- [ ] Change the wording of "NPCs" when talking about how the active side changes on a failed check; Its possible the party will have an allied NPC acting on their side, and with the current wording if such an NPC failed the initiative check then the next turn would still go to the party.
- [ ] Credits (find the video you got the idea from)

## Ideas

- For players, instead of using the characters individual initiative mod, instead each player uses the average initiative mod of the party. If there is any remainder after the division it gets given to th first few characters as +1s. Eg; If a party of 3 has a combined initiative mod of + 8, the average is 6 with a remainder of 2, so the first two characters get +3 and the third gets +2. Maybe the modifier should be minimum of 0.
