# Weapon Traits

In the world of weapons, quirks and charms are woven into the ordinary. Every blade, an individual tale, with traits that make them more than just tools.

Weapon Traits is a new mechanic that aims to add more variety to martial progression by giving players new and interesting choices to make about their weapons. A weapon that has traits is called an _irregular weapon_.

Each weapon trait falls into one of two categories; qualities and imperfections. Irregular weapons each have 1 quality and 1 imperfection. A quality represents a positive difference from standard behaviour, while an imperfection represents something negative.

## Creating an Irregular Weapon

To create an irregular weapon, the Dungeon Master selects a weapon from the weapon list to act as the base. The irregular weapon will inherit all of the stats of it's base weapon. To determine the traits of the irregular weapon, the DM rolls on both the _Qualities_ and the _Imperfections_ tables. When rolling for a trait you take the result from the column that corresponds with the type of base weapon that was chosen.

## Traits

Weapon traits are listed below along with their descriptions. If a trait is exclusive to ranged or melee weapons it will say so in its description.
