## Heading 2

### Heading 3

This playtest document is part of a series of _Unearthed Arcana_ articles that present material designed for the 2024 version of the _Player’s Handbook_. The material here uses the rules in the 2014 _Player’s Handbook_, except where noted.

After we conclude the public playtest for the _Player’s Handbook_, _Unearthed Arcana_ will explore material for the _Dungeon Master’s Guide_ and _Monster Manual_.

> This article is presented for playtesting and feedback. The options here are experimental and in draft form. They aren’t officially part of the game. Your feedback will help determine whether we adopt it as official.
